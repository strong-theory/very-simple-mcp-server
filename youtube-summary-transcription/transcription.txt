Spacetime on its smallest scales is a  seething ocean of black holes and wormholes  
0:07
flickering into and out of existence—or  so many physicists think has to be the  
0:12
case. But why should we take this spacetime foam  seriously if we’ve never seen any evidence of it?
0:24
A while ago we started talking about the  fundamentalness of space—is it the most  
0:29
elementary stage that holds all of the complexity  of physics? Or is it just the way our brains make  
0:35
sense of something that’s nothing like the space  of our experience. Well, we have good reason to at  
0:40
least doubt that the fundamental building block  of space is just more space. And that’s because  
0:46
our best theory of the nature of space—Einstein’s  general theory of relativity—is incomplete. It  
0:51
comes into severe conflict with the other great  pillar of modern physics: quantum mechanics.
0:56
We’ve spoken in the past about the source of  this conflict, and about some of the speculative  
1:02
solutions such as string theory and loop quantum  gravity. In both of these theories, space gives  
1:08
way to something rather different—something  more fundamental at the tiniest scales.  
1:13
But these theories have proved damnably difficult  to test, and so we can’t say what the most  
1:19
elementary building block of space really is. But  that doesn’t mean we can’t say something about  
1:24
what space looks like at close to the smallest  scales. By using a little logical deduction,  
1:31
we can combine general relativity and  quantum mechanics just well enough to  
1:36
trick nature into giving us an answer. And  that answer is that spacetime is … foamy.
1:43
It was John Archibald Wheeler who worked  this one out. Wheeler was a central figure  
1:47
in the development of both general relativity  and quantum mechanics, and adviser to Richard  
1:52
Feynman and Hugh Everett and Kip Thorne and many  many others. Here’s the analogy that Wheeler came  
1:58
up with to describe his conclusions about the  minutest scales of the fabric of spacetime.
2:03
Imagine you're flying in a plane over the Atlantic  ocean. From a regular cruising altitude, looking  
2:09
down, the surface of the ocean appears smooth  and relatively featureless. But, if your plane  
2:15
lowered its altitude and got closer you may start  to see the waves—from here just tiny disturbances  
2:22
in the surface of the water. But if you got  even close, perhaps on a large ship sailing  
2:28
through the waters you'd see the foam and white  caps of waves forming and breaking, and you’d  
2:33
feel their effect on your motion. And if you’re  in a rowboat the wave would be everything—you’d  
2:41
be moving through a space that was far from flat,  but rather dominated by ever changing geometries.
2:48
In this analogy, the 2-D surface of  the ocean is 3-dimensional space.  
2:52
For large creatures like us humans,  we’re flying high above and see smooth,  
2:57
flat, and perfectly continuous spatial dimensions.  But “descending” closer to the Planck scale,  
3:04
we would see ubiquitous tiny fluctuations as  distances and geometries became warped. And at  
3:11
the Planck scale, spacetime would become  so curved that black holes and wormholes  
3:15
would be popping into existence, only to vanish  again—as if our ocean were now violently boiling.
3:21
This is Wheeler’s “spacetime foam’’, and  there’s good reason to think that spacetime  
3:26
really does look like this when you’re close to  the smallest scales—regardless of your preferred  
3:31
theory of quantum gravity. We need the latter  to say what spacetime is made of—to understand  
3:36
the analogous level of the water molecules in  our ocean. However, the behavior of a quantum  
3:43
spacetime just above that level can perhaps be  understood regardless of its underlying theory,  
3:47
just as we can describe the behavior  of water without knowing its chemistry.
3:51
Today we’re going to see where the  idea of spacetime foam came from,  
3:54
and also how it might be  tested. Now we'll do this by
3:59
combining two of the fundamental ideas in  each theory of the fundamental theories the  
4:04
uncertainty of quantum mechanics and  the geometry of general relativity.  
4:08
Because spacetime foam is what you get  when geometry itself becomes uncertain.
4:15
Let’s start with the bit about uncertainty.  The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is  
4:19
one of the foundational concepts in quantum  mechanics. One version tells us that we can’t  
4:24
simultaneously know both the position and the  momentum of a particle to arbitrary precision.  
4:30
The product of their uncertainties will always  be larger than a particular very small number.
4:36
This is a very deep relationship that we get  into in detail in this episode. But let me  
4:42
also remind you of a simpler way to think  about the Heisenberg uncertainty principle  
4:47
that we covered more recently—the Heisenberg  microscope. Imagine you try to measure the  
4:52
position of an object by bouncing a photon  off it. You’ll get a more precise position  
4:57
measurement with a shorter wavelength photon.  That photon will transfer some of its momentum  
5:02
to the object, as will any measurement  attempt. The shorter the wavelength,  
5:06
the more momentum the photon can transfer.  So the more precisely you measure position,  
5:11
the less certain you become about  the final momentum of the object.
5:15
But there’s a limit to the precision  of our position measurement, even if  
5:19
we’re happy with absolute uncertainty in momentum.  
5:22
That limit is a consequence of us bringing general  relativity into the picture. GR tells us that mass  
5:28
and energy changes the geometry of space. This  is described by the Einstein field equations,  
5:34
with the mass-energy content of space completely  determining the geometry of that space.
5:40
So as our measuring photon gains  momentum and therefore energy,  
5:44
it introduces uncertainty into the geometry  of space between you and the object,  
5:49
which increases our uncertainty in the distance to  the object. So as the photon gets more energetic,  
5:57
the Heisenberg uncertainty goes down but the  uncertainty in the geometry goes up. They equal  
6:04
each other when the uncertainty is equal to the  Planck length, which is a tiny 1.6x10^-35 meters.  
6:12
So the absolute limit of our ability to  pinpoint objects in space is the Planck length.  
6:18
But what does that mean for the  structure of space on that scale?
6:23
Let’s say we now want to measure the size of  a little block of space. The measuring photon  
6:28
needs to have a wavelength at least  smaller than the width of that block.  
6:33
That photon also warps our chunk of space. The  Einstein field equations bv can tell us roughly  
6:39
when the introduced curvature is equal to the  size of the space we’re trying to measure.  
6:44
It turns out that if we try to measure the size  of a 1-Planck-length block of space, the curvature  
6:50
introduced is equal to a Planck length. We  can express our curvature uncertainty with  
6:57
a new version of the uncertainty principle that  combines quantum mechanics and general relativity.
7:03
Here we have our first glimpse of the spacetime  foam. As we peer closer and closer at the fabric  
7:09
of spacetime, we see that its curvature at  any point becomes more and more variable;  
7:15
its geometry more uncertain,  until the curvature dominates.  
7:20
What does that mean? Well, geometries that have a  radius of curvature similar to their size include  
7:26
spheres, cylinders, and black holes. So those are  the geometries that emerge at the Planck scale.  
7:34
Space at that scale curves completely back  on itself, infinitesimal black holes appear,  
7:40
and wormholes connect nearby regions. But such  Planck scale black holes would likely rapidly  
7:47
evaporate due to Hawking radiation and the  wormholes would be unstable and collapse in  
7:52
a very short amount of time. The quantum foam  is as transitory as any quantum fluctuation.
7:58
To better understand the dynamics of  the spacetime foam, let’s think about  
8:02
quantum fluctuations. For that it’s  helpful to turn to the other popular  
8:07
version of the Heisenberg uncertainty  principle, which tells us that we can’t  
8:11
simultaneously know both the energy  and the time or duration of an event.
8:17
So if you try to measure the energy  of a system at a very precise time,  
8:23
or over a very short duration, then your  energy measurement becomes highly uncertain.  
8:29
But if energy can be fundamentally  uncertain, that means there can  
8:33
be a fundamental uncertainty in the physical  contents of the universe. To understand that,  
8:39
let me give you a quick refresher on our best  theory of stuff in the universe. Quantum field  
8:44
theory and in particular the standard model of  particle physics nicely describes all matter and  
8:49
3 of the 4 forces as excitations in different  quantum fields that permeate all of space.
8:55
But because of the time-energy uncertainty  principle, we can never know the exact energy  
9:01
present in a particular patch of space. We can’t  even know that the energy is precisely zero even  
9:07
in the complete absence of real particles. What  should be a complete vacuum might be observed to  
9:14
have non-zero energy, and that becomes more likely  the shorter the timescale of our observation.  
9:20
This manifests as an underlying buzz of rapid  energy fluctuations in the quantum vacuum.  
9:27
This is sometimes described as an ocean of  virtual particles constantly appearing and  
9:31
vanishing, although it’s way more complicated than  that. Now, this isn’t quite our spacetime foam,  
9:37
because it says nothing about the shape  of the fabric of spacetime on its own.
9:41
But let’s bring general relativity back  into it. This fluctuating energy of the  
9:46
vacuum can be thought of as an uncertainty  in whatever’s sitting on the right side  
9:51
of the Einstein equations. The mass-energy  content of a tiny chunk of space is uncertain,  
9:56
so the corresponding geometry should be uncertain  also. If we think about this in terms of virtual  
10:04
particles, then every time one appears, we should  see an accompanying tiny gravitational field that  
10:09
lasts just for an instant. But because these  quantum fluctuations are extremely complex and  
10:15
constantly changing, the effect on the geometry  of space is also complex and ever-changing.  
10:20
Virtual particles aren’t even restricted to the  normal rules that real particles have—for example,  
10:25
negative masses —which means exotic  objects like wormholes can appear and  
10:31
vanish amid the general roiling mess  of spacetime at the Planck scale.
10:35
And because these quantum fluctuations are  actually in a superposition of many different  
10:40
states, we need to think of the geometry  of spacetime as also being in a quantum  
10:45
superposition at that scale. Many, and perhaps  every possible geometry exists simultaneously.  
10:53
What we see on the macroscopic  scale is the washed out sum of  
10:57
all Planck-scale configurations—and  it ends up conveniently nice and flat.
11:02
We can think of the quantum foam as  being due to an intrinsic uncertainty  
11:07
in either the stuff space contains or  in the geometry of spacetime itself.  
11:12
These are two ways to get at the same conclusion:  as long as the uncertainty principle holds in some  
11:18
reasonable way for gravity, then on the Planck  scale the fabric of spacetime should be foamy.
11:24
So now we have a picture of what space might look  like on scales well below our experience, or even  
11:29
below the experience of atoms or nuclei. How do we  test this? If the standard picture is right, then
11:35
quantum fluctuations of spacetime only  become significant near the Planck scale,  
11:40
which is far, far smaller than any of our  direct probes of spacetime structure—and  
11:45
that’ll probably be the case until we’re  a super-advanced galactic civilization.
11:50
But indirect tests are possible now. Remember  Wheeler’s analogy of spacetime foam as a choppy  
11:58
ocean surface. A gigantic ship doesn’t  notice the waves, but a rowboat does. A  
12:03
vessel in between may have a relatively smooth  ride, but might be deflected or impeded over  
12:10
time on a wavy ocean versus a still one. If  spacetime foam is real, then we might expect  
12:16
a particle traveling very long distances  to experience a slight shift in its course.
12:22
And we can test this with a surprisingly  simple experiment. A distant point of  
12:27
light can produce diffraction patterns, for  example these diffraction spikes and airy rings
12:33
if we observe through a telescope aperture or  diffraction fringes through a pair of slits. Those  
12:41
patterns are due to individual photons interfering  with themselves after interacting with the gap.  
12:48
Photons that reach us traveling in the same  direction will experience the same interference.  
12:55
By catching many such photons, we slowly  build up a single interference pattern.  
13:01
But two photons coming at even slightly  different angles will land on our  
13:05
detector according to different interference  patterns. If we look at many such photons,  
13:10
those different patterns will be overlaid  on each other and result in just a blur.
13:16
That’s why we see diffraction spikes  around stars in Hubble or even JWST images,  
13:23
but we only see a blurry blob from even our best  ground-based telescopes. In the latter case,  
13:29
light from the star is bounced around by our  atmosphere so that it arrives traveling in  
13:35
slightly different directions. Well, if spacetime  is foamy then we might expect a similar effect  
13:41
for light arriving from very great distances.  Stars in our own galaxy are not far enough away,  
13:48
but some objects like quasars and gamma ray  bursts can be billions of light years distant.
13:54
A number of studies have tried to detect the  effect of spacetime foam on the diffraction  
13:59
patterns of distant objects in Hubble Space  Telescope data. Hubble is particularly good  
14:05
because it’s very sensitive to ultraviolet  light—a short wavelength light that should  
14:09
be more influenced by a turbulent spacetime  fabric compared to, say, the long-wavelength  
14:15
infrared light that JWST is sensitive to. So  far the best these studies have been able to  
14:20
do is to rule out certain models which produce a  particularly strong spacetime foam. But some of  
14:25
the measurements are tantalizingly close to  the needed sensitivity, so perhaps a bigger  
14:31
ultra-violet-sensitive space telescope will be  able to detect this effect. More work is needed.
14:37
Only then could we really be  sure that a tempestuous ocean  
14:41
of uncertain geometries underlies  our deceptively placid spacetime.
